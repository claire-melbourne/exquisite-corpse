There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Exquisite Corps-y -- Write your own surprising tales

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A creative project for friends to pass the time virtually

## Summary ##
  > An app which allows users to collaboratively write a story and delivers a final virtual version of the story with image and sound accompaniment that users can come back to and share with others.

## Problem ##
  > Bookish, nostalgic writer-types not having enough ways to bond with each other creatively

## Solution ##
  > Maybe back in the day, you and a friend or two would take turns writing a line of some outlandish story on a napkin at a bar, folding the napkin over to cover all but the last word, so the next friend could continue it on. When there was no more napkin to fold, you'd all open it up and laugh at the absurdly wacky or suprisingly logical story you'd created, an exquisite corps of story lines. Maybe now you don't go to bars, but you still think you and your friends are clever. Exquisite Corps-y lets you play the game virtually, create a story and take turns adding lines until you're satisfied, then sit back and enjoy as the tale enfolds.

## Quote from You ##

## How to Get Started ##
  > Enter a name for your story on the home page and the authors, then the first author can submit the first sentence or two of a story, first thought best thought, for the next author to add onto. Keep in mind, the next author will only be able to see the last word of your submission and build from there. At the end, Exquisite Corps-y will reveal the whole story!

## Customer Quote ##
  > 'Sending memes back and forth with my friends that I never see anymore was getting old. Exquisite Corps-y allows us to connect through humor in creativity in a way that brings us closer than we've felt since before COVID."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Invite your friends to an Exquisite Corps-y and start writing your own.
